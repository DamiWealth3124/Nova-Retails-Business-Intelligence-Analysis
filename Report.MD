**Nova-Retails Business Intelligence Analysis**

Supply Optimization, Promotion Effectiveness & Market Performance

**Business Problem / Objective**

Nova-Retails management wants full visibility into operational efficiency and market performance across products, categories, regions, and promotions.

- The leadership team needs to understand:

This project answers the core question:

How can Nova-Retails optimize supply, pricing, and promotions to maximize revenue while minimizing inventory risk?

**Key Insights**

**1. Executive KPIs**

- Total Revenue reached $455M

- 5M sales transactions generated 7M units sold

- Average discount remained moderate at 9.1%

- Selling price ($68) is slightly below competitor pricing ($69), indicating competitive positioning

**2️. Inventory vs Orders Trend**

- Inventory levels fluctuated between 0.7M – 1.1M units

- Sales volume generally tracks orders but shows occasional mismatches

- Certain periods show excess inventory buildup — potential holding cost risk

Insight: Supply planning can be optimized to reduce overstock cycles.

**3️. Units Sold by Product**

- Product P0003 dominates with over 3M units sold

- P0002 and P0005 follow at significantly lower levels

- Lower-tier products show weak demand

Insight: Revenue concentration is driven by a few hero products.

**4️. Promotional Impact**

- 62% of total sales occurred without promotions

- 38% were driven by promotional campaigns

Insight: Promotions contribute meaningfully but organic demand remains strong.
Opportunity exists to test targeted promotions rather than blanket discounts.

**5️. Sales vs Orders Gap**

- P0003 shows high alignment between orders and sales

- Other products show a drop-off from ordered to sold units

Insight: Some products may be over-forecasted.

**6️. Revenue by Category**

- Groceries lead total revenue

- Furniture and Clothing follow

- Toys contribute the least

Insight: Core revenue is concentrated in essential categories.

**7️. Revenue by Region**

- North region dominates revenue performance

- South underperforms relative to others

Insight: Expansion strategies should prioritize strong-performing regions while investigating barriers in weaker markets.

**8️. Pricing Comparison**

- Prices closely mirror competitor averages

- Minor monthly fluctuations suggest reactive pricing strategy

Insight: There is room for strategic price differentiation rather than reactive matching.

**9️. Demand Variation by Season**

- Summer shows peak demand

- Winter shows the lowest

Insight: Strong seasonal patterns require dynamic inventory allocation.

**10. Sales by Weather Condition**

- Sunny and Cloudy conditions drive the highest sales

- Snowy conditions significantly reduce demand

Insight: Weather-sensitive forecasting can improve stock planning.
